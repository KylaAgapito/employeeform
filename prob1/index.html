<!-- You are tasked to display a small product list in your webpage or an unlined shop prototype. 
The list needs to show each product and its corresponding price clearly. You decide to use an HTML 
table with appropriate headers for better readability and structure. How would you write the HTML 
code to create a simple table with two columns, labeled Product and Price. Include two rows of data 
beneath the header row, make sure to include the <thead> and <tbody> sections for semantic structure.  -->
